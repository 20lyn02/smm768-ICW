<h1>Singapore Airlines: Customer Review Analysis & Strategic Recommendations</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project analysed thousands of customer reviews for Singapore Airlines using topic modelling (BERTopic) and additional NLP techniques. The goal was to identify the main drivers behind a decline in customer ratings and present actionable recommendations to the CEO. Findings were synthesised into a concise strategy deck focused on elevating customer satisfaction and reinforcing the airline’s premium positioning.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>  
- <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>  
- <b>BERTopic</b>  
- <b>Pandas & NumPy</b>  
- <b>Matplotlib / Plotly</b>  
- <b>Deep Learning Extensions for Text Analysis</b>  


<h2>Methodology</h2>

1. <b>Data Exploration & Cleaning</b>  
   - Processed large-scale customer review text data for Singapore Airlines.  
   - Removed noise (stopwords, special characters) and prepared text for topic modelling.  

2. <b>Topic Modelling (BERTopic)</b>  
   - Extracted recurring themes from reviews such as service quality, staff behaviour, baggage handling, booking processes, and seating comfort.  
   - Grouped reviews into coherent clusters and identified sentiment orientation.  

3. <b>Deep Learning Extensions</b>  
   - Enhanced topic interpretability with embeddings and dimensionality reduction.  
   - Applied qualitative review analysis to validate themes and uncover hidden drivers of dissatisfaction.  

4. <b>Insight Generation</b>  
   - Connected identified issues (e.g., slow refunds, inconsistent crew service, outdated booking UI) with actionable levers for customer experience improvements.  

5. <b>Strategic Recommendations</b>  
   - Developed targeted proposals aligned with insights:  
     - Smarter AI chatbots for faster query resolution.  
     - Automated refund system for minor claims.  
     - Crew retraining programmes focused on empathy and professionalism.  
     - Mystery Flyer programme to evaluate and incentivise staff performance.  
     - Premium service upgrades for Premium Economy and Business Class.  
     - Modernised booking system with real-time sync and simplified amendments.  


<h2>Findings</h2>

- Topic modelling highlighted key pain points: **customer service delays**, **refund inefficiencies**, **crew inconsistency**, and **baggage mishandling**.  
- Positive reviews were strongly linked to premium class experiences, attentive staff, and smooth booking processes.  
- **AI-powered service upgrades** (chatbots + automation) would reduce response times and operational strain.  
- **Staff retraining and evaluation programmes** could reinforce professionalism and empathy across service delivery.  
- **Premium upgrades** (improved meals, facilities, and aircraft models) are critical to maintaining Singapore Airlines’ reputation as a premium global carrier.  
- The combined recommendations provide a roadmap to restore customer confidence, improve satisfaction ratings, and strengthen competitive positioning.
